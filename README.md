# Christmas Fifteen Puzzle

A holiday-themed sliding puzzle game built for CSC 4370/6370 Web Programming.

## Project Overview

This project implements a classic fifteen puzzle game with a festive Christmas theme. Players can solve puzzles of various sizes, track their progress, and unlock holiday-themed rewards.

## AI Usage Disclosure

This project skeleton and initial structure were created with the assistance of AI tools. Specifically:

- **Project Structure**: AI was used to generate the complete file and folder structure based on the project requirements and team member responsibilities. This included organizing files into frontend, backend, database, and documentation directories with appropriate subdirectories.

- **Wireframe Planning**: AI assistance was used to help plan and conceptualize the wireframes and design layout for the application. The wireframes are documented in `docs/DESIGN.md`.

- **File Organization**: AI helped organize the project structure to support parallel development by three team members, with clear separation of concerns and responsibilities.

All code implementation, logic, and functionality will be developed by the team members. The AI was used solely for initial project scaffolding and planning assistance.
